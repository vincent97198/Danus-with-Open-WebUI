"""Schemas + content-addressed fact id for the three core data structures.

Kept minimal on purpose: code only models the *fixed* parts of the data
structures (the fact node and the fact id). Behavior — when to publish, verify,
promote — is prose (prompts/skills), not code.

The glossary (``glossary_introduces``) is kept: it is what makes a fact readable
and composable (every symbol has a definition somewhere). See ``DATA_MODEL.md``
§3 and ``glossary.py``. ``compute_fact_id`` is the Danus scheme, including the
glossary term.
