"""Role -> allowed-tools table — the permission skeleton of the whole system.

This is the single, first-class source of truth for separation of duties: which
MCP tools each agent role may even see. It is data (easy to audit / change), not
logic scattered across the server.

Invariants (load-bearing — see ARCHITECTURE.md §3):
  - ``main`` has NO ``fact_submit``: the orchestrator does no math and can never
    fabricate a fact.
  - ``verifier`` is read-only: only literature retrieval tools (it reads the fact
    graph as files, writes nothing).
  - ``worker`` is the only role that can ``fact_submit`` (verifier-gated write).
All three roles get the literature tools (search and original-paper reading); ``worker``
and ``main`` additionally get ``fact_search`` (read view over verified facts).
