"""human-summary — the human-summary skill's MCP service (role-gated: main only).

Wraps the isolated report writer behind a hard-coded MCP tool so the main agent
gets a clean ``report.md`` **without ever authoring the prose itself and without
ever reading the fact files**. The large bytes (the writer prompt + the scrubbed
fact bundle) are assembled inside the tool (``assemble.py``) and never pass
through the main agent's context, and the writer's codex runs isolated by
construction (``danus.authoring.driver`` — empty cwd + fully-embedded prompt).

The structural fix this service is: the report author is an ISOLATED codex fed a
scrubbed, id-free bundle — it is impossible for it to receive ``fact_id`` /
``author`` / ``predecessors`` / other frontmatter or swarm/orchestration
vocabulary, because ``assemble.py`` strips all of it. A regex LEAK CHECK on the
codex output is the backstop: a report that still contains a hex id, an ``author:``
line, a ``fact_`` slug, or machinery terms is reported ``status != ok`` and is NOT
kept.

Tool returns are **small and honest**: paths + status + flags, never the full
report. ``status`` is ``ok`` only on a zero exit AND non-empty output AND zero leak
findings; a nonzero exit, empty stdout, timeout, or any leak is not ``ok``.

Config resolution (env read at CALL time):

  DANUS_HUMAN_SUMMARY_SKILL_DIR                 the writer prompt (see assemble.py)
  DANUS_CODEX_BIN                               codex binary
  DANUS_HUMAN_SUMMARY_MODEL / DANUS_HUMAN_SUMMARY_EFFORT   per-service codex

    nothing enters your context), drives an ISOLATED local codex, writes its
