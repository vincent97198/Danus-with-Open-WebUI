# Danus — Operations Runbook

Day-to-day operation of a Danus deployment: the persistent services, health checks,
recovery after a restart, and unattended-operation helpers.

> In normal operation you do not run these commands yourself — you talk to the
> **main agent** (codex), and it runs them for you. This page documents what
> happens underneath, and doubles as your fallback for the moments the main agent
> is not there to act (a fresh host restart, a session that will not start,
> debugging the stack by hand).

## The persistent services

Two services must be managed via `scripts/services.sh`, which `setsid`-detaches each
so it **survives your shell / SSH session ending** (a bare `&` would die with the
shell). Start them only this way.

```bash
bash scripts/services.sh up verify            # REQUIRED — no verify ⇒ fact_submit fails ⇒ no facts
bash scripts/services.sh up dashboard <p>     # optional read-only view of project <p>
bash scripts/services.sh status               # what's up (+ a verify /health probe)
bash scripts/services.sh logs <svc> [-f]      # tail a service log
bash scripts/services.sh down <svc> | all     # stop
```

- **verify** — `127.0.0.1:8091`. The correctness gate. Must be up before starting
  any workers.
- **dashboard** — `127.0.0.1:8099`, read-only. View it via an SSH port-forward
  (do not expose it to a network).

> **Shared-host caveat.** These ports are per-host, not per-deployment. If a second
> Danus deployment (another user/checkout) is already bound to `8091`, your
> `services.sh up verify` will **fail to bind** (`address already in use`). A bare
> health probe cannot tell your verify from the other one, so `/health` now
> **self-identifies with the serving process pid**: `doctor.sh` and `services.sh
> status`/`test` match that pid against your `runtime/run/verify.pid` and report the
> port as **`FAIL … answered by a FOREIGN process`** instead of a false `ok` when
> another deployment holds it. On a shared host, give each deployment its own
> `VERIFY_PORT` / `DASHBOARD_PORT` (`config/danus.env`).

`services.sh` keeps a pid registry under `runtime/run/` and an `autostart` manifest
of `up` invocations, so a restart can replay them (see recovery).

## Health checks

```bash
bash scripts/doctor.sh          # green / FAIL / warn across the whole stack
bash scripts/check-codex.sh     # one live codex ping + scan recent logs for API errors
```

- `doctor.sh` is read-only: config files, python + verify deps, node, the codex
  wrapper + backend, a live verify `/health`, and soft checks for `pdflatex` /
  Chrome. Run it whenever something looks off. A real healthy run (chatgpt backend,
  no TeX installed):

  ```
  == Danus doctor ==
  DANUS_ROOT=/home/you/Danus
    ok   config/danus.env present
    ok   config/codex.env present
    ok   python: .../runtime/venv/bin/python
    ok   python dep: mcp
    ok   python pkg: danus (importable from any cwd)
    ok   python deps: fastapi/uvicorn/pydantic
    ok   node: .../runtime/node22/bin/node
    ok   codex: codex-cli 0.142.5
    ok   codex login ok (/home/you/codex-home)
    ok   verify service up :8091 (ours)
    warn no pdflatex on PATH (write-paper PDF render needs it; set TEX_ENGINE or install TeX)
    ok   chrome: /usr/bin/chromium-browser (human-summary PDF)
  done.
  ```

  (`warn` lines are soft/optional deps, not failures; on the api backend the codex
  lines read `codex backend: api provider configured` + `codex API live ping ok`.)
- `check-codex.sh` exits `0` if the backend answered; history in
  `runtime/logs/codex-health.jsonl`. Use it when workers/verify show API errors.

## Recovery after a host restart

```bash
bash scripts/recover.sh
```

One command: re-runs `bootstrap.sh` (rebuilds the possibly-dangling venv + codex
provider), clears stale pidfiles, **replays the `runtime/run/autostart` manifest**
(brings the services back up), and prints codex + services health. Idempotent.

> Note: after a restart, worker loops are **not** auto-resumed by `recover.sh` — it
> restores the services. Restart workers with `danus start <project>` (they resume
> from persisted memory).

## Worker lifecycle (operational view)

```bash
danus status <project>          # per-worker liveness + round + last activity
danus start  <project>          # (re)launch the worker loop(s); resumes from memory
danus stop   <project>          # graceful: finish the round, then exit
danus stop   <project> --force  # kill the process group now
```

- Workers run detached in their own process groups, so they outlive your session and
  a graceful stop lets an in-flight round finish (no lost verified work). `--force`
  kills a live codex child.
- `status` shows a `stuck?` soft signal when a running round exceeds ~1.5× the hard
  timeout — investigate (often a flaky backend); decide stop/restart.

## Unattended operation (examples, not core)

Under `examples/ops/` (parameterized; nothing in the engine depends on them):

- `main-agent-tmux.sh` — run codex (the main agent) detached in a tmux
  session, so strategic beats continue while you are away. **The only unattended
  mode.**
- `watchdog.sh <project>` — probe verify `/health` + parse `danus status`; alarm via
  a generic `DANUS_NOTIFY` hook on a `stuck?`/`dead`/`error` worker or a down verify.

## Common issues

| symptom | check |
|---|---|
| no facts appearing | is `verify` up? `services.sh status`; `doctor.sh` |
| workers erroring in rounds | `check-codex.sh`; `runtime/logs/codex-health.jsonl`; the worker's `logs/round_*.log` |
| a `paper_*` tool came back non-`ok` | read the returned `log_path` (`<project>/paper/.runs/<utc>-<tool>/log.md`) |
| dashboard blank | port-forward `:8099`; is the dashboard service up for that project? |
| after reboot, nothing runs | `recover.sh`, then `danus start <project>` |

See `configuration.md` for the variables that tune all of the above, and
`security-and-trust.md` for the trust assumptions behind the sandbox-bypassed codex
sessions.
